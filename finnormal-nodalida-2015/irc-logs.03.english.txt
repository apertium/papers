there was a really cute boy today, he just wanted to ask about the algorithm, not specifically about Java
then I gave him pen and paper and sat next to him and watched while he sketched out what happens
(it was only like 3 lines inside a loop)
and then he figured it out and my task was just to say that yay you got it right you get a biscuit :3
there was nobody else in the queue so I just stood by and watched when a cute boy codes on paper ^^ at some point there was more queue, so I just told him that ok now you know what to do, continue with that
yeah I know :-P
oh and when they write their names on the board, I'm always calling out "Matias och Karl", "Johan och Elin" and so on
then one group had written PlayPoy & Curls
but then I just shouted out loud pleipoi o köörls
my English accent is also different when I speak Swedish :-P
or I mean when I have to say something like public static void main while I'm speaking Swedish
one asked something like if a constructor can be private, I said that lol no idea, but let's search on Stackoverflow
and I said that sorry I don't know anything about Java but you can ask advanced questions about Haskell
then the student was like oh I thought you're all like Java kings
but it went over the head of the student and I started explaining all the time more basic things and at that point there was queue so I said that sorry, got to go
that would be a good skill for me too
on mondays I have 4 hours of teaching and after that 3 hours of choir
"sorry I'm from Finland, we don't talk"
in other news, we sang Pippi Longstocking in Swedish and I realised that the lyrics are fucking annoying
not that it particularly elevates the mind in Finnish either but when you sing it in Swedish you just want to strangle the brat
well ok the alto part is dum *tsh* dum *tsh* and thank you third ledger line
that by the way also makes you lose your voice
when you have to sing dum *tsh* dum *tsh*
hemmetti: do you have hints
yesterday was like that oh fuck why third alto
but we had cool songs to :-D we sang this but like speed competition version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIminxPjb5I
was this the thing where something was about to be privatised and that's why there was a strike
is it same as "quickly"?
ooh what, is there snow?
my language intuation is a bit weak on that kind of thing
there aren't three syllables in the verb "maata" in the a-infinitive
yeah, the verb has a glottal stop at the end
I was just protesting that there's no syllable break between the two i's
' as an alphabetical character makes tokenisation harder
well ok there's ' in english too
well I mean, if a reanalysis is born and the people use the form, it exists
Swedish ma-infinitive illative after the word börjar or
in the previous one there was eastern and western dialects the right way round :-P
they will organise your lodging
I remember when Susu was horrified that I had dared to ask for 200 euros for the performance of the whole choir
are they going to pay Annika anything for what she is going to do there?
I lastlogged but I didn't find the context
I'm going to Tartu to speak for two hours and of course they pay for my hotel
Ruhtinas: omg me too :-O
I just found out on Tuesday that our choir's president lives in the same building as me
if I feel like singing, I can go knock on her door
this just came to my mind about neighbours
well, sounds good, as in they weren't like the Japan day people "choir, you can pay your own travel so that you can sing one song during the coffee break -- well okay you can come on the same bus"
