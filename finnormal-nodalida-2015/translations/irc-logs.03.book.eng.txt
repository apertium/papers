today was one awfully cute boy, he wanted to ask just the algorithm is not particularly Java
I gave him a pen and paper, and I followed next, when he sketched that what happens
(it was, therefore, only three to a row within a loop)
and then he came up, and my job was just to say that "gee went right, you get a cookie: 3"
there was no one else in the queue, so I watched just next to the cute boy paperikoodaa. At some point was more then the queue, so I just said "ok, now you know what to do, to continue this"
I know:-P
and when they want to embroider names on the board, I always calling out that "Matias och Karl", "Johan och body", etc.

one was asking about something that can have a private constructor, I said that "I do not know, but let's see Stackoverflow'sta"
and I said "I'm sorry, I do not know anything about Java, but yes, you can ask more advanced questions Haskell"
then the student was only the "Aijaa. I thought that you all Java-kings"
but yes the student went over their heads, and began to explain more and more fundamental issue, and the stage was a queue, so I said "excuse me, now have to go"
that would be just fine skill to me

I remember when Susu was terrified when kehtasin ask for 200 euro * entire * the presence of the choir

I just found out Tuesday that our choir Chairman lives in the same house as me
if you are singing, so I can go knock on his door
This came to mind the neighbors
