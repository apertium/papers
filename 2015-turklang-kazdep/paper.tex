\abstract{
This article describes the first steps towards a free/open-source dependency treebank for Kazakh based on universal dependency (UD) annotation standards. The treebank contains 302 sentences and is based on texts from a range of open-source and public domain sources. This ensures its free availability and extensibility. Texts in the treebank are first morphologically analysed and disambiguated and then annotated manually for dependency structure.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Kazakh}

Kazakh (қазақ тілі), a Turkic language of Central Asia with around 12 million speakers, hargle bargle. %FIXME

In the process of designing a Kazakh transducer \citep{Washington14}, several decisions were made about how various inflectional morphemes affect the part of speech and syntactic function of various word forms.  These decisions include the relations to other words defined by ``case'' morphemes, and processes of ``zero derivation''.

All of the traditionally defined ``cases'' in Kazakh have a variety of uses.  The morphemes that mark the accusative and genitive cases are only used when the noun phrase is semantically definite.  This means that indefinite accusative and genitive as well as nominative noun phrases are all unmarked for case, and hence are all ambiguous.  Our Kazakh transducer marks these all as \tag{nom}, but their use may be disambiguated.  Besides identifying the semantic role of an unmarked noun phrase, there are various agreement properties that make it clear what ``case'' the noun phrase ``truly'' receives: genitive noun phrases must have a corresponding noun phrase with possessive morphology that agrees in person with the genitive noun phrase; and nominative noun phrases must have a corresponding predicate that agrees in person with the nominative noun phrase, e.g., a verb or a copula.

Copulas may also be non-overt.  In the present tense, all but third person copulas have realised forms, but the third person copula does not surface.

Adjectives in Kazakh are by default attributive, but many may also be used either nominally (i.e., as nouns) or adverbially (i.e., as adverbs), or both.  Our morphological transducer internally provides a series of classes; depending on class membership, an adjective may receive readings \tag{adj}\tag{advl} or \tag{adj}\tag{subst}, besides the default attributive reading of \tag{adj}.  If an adjective may be used substantivally, then it will receive a range of substantive morphology as well.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

Preprocessing the corpus consists of running the text through the Kazakh morphological
analyser \citep{Washington14}, which also performs tokenisation of multiword units based 
the longest match left-to-right. Tokenisation for Kazakh is a non-trivial task, and so
we do not simply take space as a delimiter. The morphological analyser returns all 
the possible morphological analyses for each word based on a lexicon of around 20,000 lexemes.
After tokenisation and morphological analysis, the text is processed with a constraint-grammar 
based disambiguator for Kazakh consisting of 113 rules which remove inappropriate 
analyses in context. This reduces the average number of analyses per word from around 3.4
to around 1.7.
