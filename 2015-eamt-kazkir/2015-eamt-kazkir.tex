\section{Introduction}

\section{Previous work}
\label{sec:prev}

Within the Apertium project, work on several MT systems between Turkic languages has been started (Kazakh--Tatar, Tatar--Bashkir, Turkish--Kyrgyz, and Azeri--Turkish).  There are two published works describing these systems, the first is \cite{tyerswashingtonsalimzyanbattalov12} which describes a Tatar--Bashkir machine translation system; due to the closeness of these languages, it proved to provide high accuracy in its translations, but being a prototype system by design, had relatively low coverage. The second is \cite{tyerswashingtonsalimzyan13} which describes a high-coverage Kazakh--Tatar system.

Besides these systems, several previous works on making machine translation systems between Turkic languages 
exist, although to our knowledge none are publicly available except for the Turkish--Azerbaijani pair available through Google Translate.\footnote{\url{http://translate.google.com}}
Some MT systems have been reported that translate between Turkish and other Turkic languages, 
including Turkish--Crimean Tatar \citep{altintas01},
Turkish--Azerbaijani \citep{hamzaoglu93}, Turkish--Tatar \citep{suleymanov08}, and
Turkish--Turkmen \citep{tantug07}, though none of these have been released to a public audience.
