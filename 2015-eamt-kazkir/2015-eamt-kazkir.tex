\section{Introduction}

This paper presents a comparison of approaches to machine translation
from Kazakh to Kyrgyz.
The paper will be laid out as follows: Section~\ref{sec:prev}\ gives a short review of some previous work in the area of Turkic--Turkic language machine translation; Section~\ref{sec:lang} introduces Kazakh and Kyrgyz and compares their grammar;
Section~\ref{sec:sys}\ describes the systems we built and the tools used to construct them;
Section~\ref{sec:eval}\ gives an evaluation of the systems; and
finally Section~\ref{sec:conc}\ describes our aims for future work and some
concluding remarks.


\section{Previous work}
\label{sec:prev}

Within the Apertium project, work on several MT systems between Turkic languages has been started (Kazakh--Tatar, Tatar--Bashkir, Turkish--Kyrgyz, and Azeri--Turkish).  There are two published works describing these systems, the first is \cite{tyerswashingtonsalimzyanbattalov12} which describes a Tatar--Bashkir machine translation system; due to the closeness of these languages, it proved to provide high accuracy in its translations, but being a prototype system by design, had relatively low coverage. The second is \cite{tyerswashingtonsalimzyan13} which describes a high-coverage Kazakh--Tatar system.

Besides these systems, several previous works on making machine translation systems between Turkic languages 
exist, although to our knowledge none are publicly available except for the Turkic--Turkic pairs (including Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Turkish, and Uzbek) available through Google Translate.\footnote{\url{http://translate.google.com}}
Some MT systems have been reported that translate between Turkish and other Turkic languages, 
including Turkish--Crimean Tatar \citep{altintas01},
Turkish--Azerbaijani \citep{hamzaoglu93}, Turkish--Tatar \citep{suleymanov08}, and
Turkish--Turkmen \citep{tantug07}, though none of these have been released to a public audience.

\section{Approaches}

\subsection{Rule-based machine translation}

\cite{washingtonsalimzyantyers14}
\cite{washingtonipasovtyers12}

\subsection{Corpus-based machine translation}

We trained models based on two approaches, the first being phrase-based machine translation (PBMT, \cite{zens2002}) and the second on character-based machine translation (CBMT, \cite{nakov2012}; \cite{TiedemannEAMT2009}).

\subsection{Corpus}

\subsubsection{Phrase-based}

\subsubsection{Character-based }

\cite{nakov2012} present a method of statistical machine translation on the character level between related languages that takes advantage of phrase-based machine translation architecture. 
%The method relies on preprocessing the input and output by inserting spaces in between the characters of words, for example the string `m\"{a} meen Helsinkiin' would become `m \"{a} \$ m e e n \$ H e l s i n k i i n' with a unigram model, or `m\"{a} \"{a}\$ \$m me ee en n\$ \$H He el ls si in nk ki ii in' with a bigram model.

%After preprocessing, the corpora are processed as with the phrase-based system, with the difference that the language model order is increased from 5 to 10-grams.
