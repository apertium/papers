it's 4 hours of Java in Swedish again
so far I've got two questions
"if input is not in the right format, throw an exception" "do I need to throw an exception or what should I do"
then there was someone who was confused about how lists are indexed
I'm probably quite unapproachable tutor when I just talk on IRC and look scared
fourth question was that why public int blaablaa() doesn't work without return statement
now I'm in a different classroom than last week, this is nicer because I can hang out in front and I see everyone
should I take beer with me next time
and then I could give it to my students too so it would be relaxed
I'm just so scared that I'm typoing
it was by the way funny yesterday to look at vote percentages by area
there where I lived before, in a family suburb, major part was like the local Coalition party 30+%
except one area, that has a massive student apartment cluster
like the whole road, numbers 1-19 are student apartments
there the biggest party was Greens
now I'm starting to feel normal again
I'm sure it'll get easier week by week
then they asked me help that why doesn't it work when they have first a return statement and then print
aha now there were guys who thought that this is the lab session for parallel programming
yay now there were questions about null for three lines in a row
some asked about Eclipse and I said that after two weeks you'll know Eclipse lot better than me
I remembered something at least, that it throws .class files in a different directory
and then they asked if they should create a new project or Java project or a class
yeah I don't intend to be entertaining, I'm just busying myself to calm my nerves
questions come so often that I can't do anything useful
I browsed Facebook and I was just confused
then I nodded and waved back and he started walking
but I also became very feverish last night
I'll come to Helsinki next weekend
but I heard there's a good chance that it isn't full
and if we go early, probably we'll fit fine
are you now my real friends since you're not anymore school friends
sometimes I have a good flow and sometimes I'm showing angle brackets with my hands
it's okay, but this is not yet completely in my comfort zone
and isn't pharmacist too?
and they recommend for example that you go to a research exchange after licentiate
what I've looked at friends' licentiate theses, it's enough to have for example 3 shortish papers, one had just one extended paper
"one extended paper" which means 69 pages
the three papers guy has 49 pages in total
have you got more fit after the beginning
or are you still weak
or do you get used to it
why now just one? less passengers?
she said that she earned as a PhD student for Langnet 11 euros per hour
but if I remember correctly, if she had been full-time, the gross salary would've been around 2000
I haven't here either calculated the hourly wage, in euros my gross salary is almost 3000
or well ~2850, I had the impression that last autumn it was more, maybe the exchange rate has changed or something
but enough that I don't bother to worry about how much it is :-P
hmm, tutoring makes you a bit stiff, when you bend over the first year students' screens all the time
or they are patient about my bad swedish :-P then some, even if they wouldn't be the most clueless, just feel more difficult
of course like the ideal question is from someone who already knows basic things, and asks only some detail
or maybe not ideal, but easiest to answer
