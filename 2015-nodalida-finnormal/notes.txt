    Unsupervised automatic conversion of colloquial Finnish to standard Finnish 

Abstract

Introduction

* Most language technology is based on standard language. Application to non-standard
  language can cause a substantial decrease in quality. [example for fin-eng translation]

* Given this, there are two options, either create new tools to process non-standard text,
  or create tools to convert non-standard text to standardised text. This paper describes 
  the latter.

* We present a small parallel corpus of standard Finnish and colloquial Finnish and describe
  some experiments in converting from colloquial Finnish to standard Finnish.

Corpus

* Description of corpus. 

* Corpus created by manual "translation" of colloquial Finnish texts (IRC logs)
  into standard Finnish. The conversion process was two-step. First a character/context-free
  conversion was done. Then this was altered to preserve meaning. 

* Examples.

* [Table!]

* The corpus is not large enough to be able to reliably train statistical machine translation
  models, but is large enough to provide an objective evaluation of unsupervised methods
