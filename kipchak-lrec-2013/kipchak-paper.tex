\section{Introduction}

This paper describes the development of morphological transducers for three closly related languages: Kazakh, Tatar, and Kumyk.

These languages belong to the Northwestern branch of Turkic, which is often referred to as the Kypchak branch.  This branch can be divided into three subbranches.  Kumyk is a member of the Western Kypchak group, Tatar is a member of the Northern Kypchak group, and Kazakh is a member of the Southern Kypchak group \citep[82-83]{histofturkic}.  As such, each of these three languages represents a different one of the three branches of Kypchak.  The geographic distribution of the languages is shown in map \ref{}.

In a linguistic sense, these languages have different amounts of influence from other Turkic branches (e.g., moderate Oguz (SE) influence in the Western group, slight Oguz influence in the Northern group) and from Mongolic languages (moderate influence on the Southern group, lighter in the other groups), and all have heavy influence from Persian.

The transducers for these languages 

\section{Languages}

\subsection{Kazakh}
Kazakh is primarily spoken in Kazakhstan, where it is the national language, sharing official status with Russian as an official language.  Large communities of native speakers also exist in China, neighbouring Central-Eurasian republics, and Mongolia.  Estimates of the total number of speakers range from 8 million \citep{ethnologue} to 11 million \citet{encyclopedin} people.

\subsection{Tatar}
Tatar is spoken in and around Tatarstan by approximately 5.4 million people \citep{ethnologue}. It is co-official with Russian in Tatarstan --- a republic within Russia.  A majority of native speakers of both languages are bilingual in Russian. %, and the standard varieties our system FIXMEs are written in Cyrillic.

\subsection{Kumyk}
Kumyk is spoken in Dagestan, a Republic of the Russia Federation, where it is co-official with a number of other languages.  There are approximately 430 thousand speakers \cite{ethnologue}.

\section{Methodology}

% Noun morphotactics -- is basically equivalent in all three, except for archiphonemes
% Adjective categorisation
% Adverb categorisation
% "Irregular" harmony, caused by orthography
% Non-finite verb form categorisation "converbs"

% Handling numerals and acronyms.

\subsection{Development effort}
% how long it took
% make a graph for the kumyk one

\section{Evaluation}

We have evaluated the morphological analysers in two ways. The first was by calculating the naïve coverage\footnote{Naïve coverage refers to the percentage of surface forms in a given corpora that receive at least one analysis.  Forms counted by this measure may have other analyses which are not delivered by the transducer.} and mean ambiguity 
on freely available corpora. The second was by performing an evaluation of precision and recall on some 
smaller, hand-validated test sets.

\subsection{Corpora}

% For kazakh+tatar tested the coverage of the analysers over 3 separate domains: encyclopaedic text, news and religion, 
% as there was no wikipedia for kumyk we just tested news and religion. The corpora were obtained from:
% Wikipedia:
% RFE/RL
% Yoldaš: 
% New testaments:

% kaz: kkwiki-20131006-pages-articles.xml.bz2
% tat:

\section{Future work}

%Code switching - +example
%More languages: Nogai, Bashkir, Karakalpak, Karachay-Balkar

We would like to thank the Google Code-in (2011) for supporting the development 
of the Kazakh transducer, and in particular the effort by Nathan Maxson. We 
would also like to thank the Google Summer of Code (2012) for supporting the 
development of both the Kazakh and the Tatar transducers.
