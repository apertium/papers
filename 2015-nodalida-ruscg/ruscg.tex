\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
 This paper presents preliminary work on a constraint
 grammar based disambiguator for Russian. Russian is
 a Slavic language with a high degree of both in-category
 and out-category homonymy in the inflectional system.
 The pipeline consists of a finite-state morphological
 analyser and constraint grammar. The constraint 
 grammar is tuned to be high recall at the expense of 
 low precision.

\section{Introduction}

Our purposes: Processing stressed wordforms and open-source machine translation

\cite{Karlsson-90}

% objectives:
%% make a free/open-source morphology for russian based on Z's dictionary that includes stress

\section{Review of literature}

State-of-the-art morphological analysis in Russian is primarily based on
finite-state technology
\cite{Nozhov-03,Segalovich-03}.\footnote{Machine-learning approaches have also been successfully applied to Russian, most notably by 
\newcite{sharoff08lrec-mocky}.} Almost without exception, all large-scale 
morphological transducers of Russian are based on the
forward-looking \emph{Grammatical Dictionary of Russian} \cite{Zaliznjak-77}.
This dictionary gives fine-grained morphological specifications for more than
100~000 words, including inflectional endings, morphophonemic alternations, 
stress patterns, exceptions, and idiosyncratic collocations.
We base our work on the recently developed [anonymous] morphological transducer, which is also based on Zaliznjak's dictionary (Author, 2015).\footnote{The [anonymous] transducer is implemented using a two-level 
morphology \cite{Koskenniemi-84}, and can be compiled using either {\tt xfst}
\cite{Beesley.Karttunen-03} or {\tt hfst} \cite{hfst-11}} This finite-state transducer (FST) generates all possible 
morphosyntactic readings of each wordform, regardless of its frequency or probability. Because Russian is a relatively highly inflected language, broad coverage is important, but widespread homonymy leads to the generation of many spurious readings, as discussed in Section~\ref{ambiguity} below. Because of this, one of the foundational steps in Russian natural language processing is morphosyntactic disambiguation, or \emph{snjatie omonimii}.

Grammar\footnote{Implemented using vislcg3 constraint grammar parser
(http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html).}
\cite{Karlsson-90,Karlsson.Voutilainen.ea-95} then removes
some readings based on syntactic context.

\section{Ambiguity in Russian} \label{ambiguity}

We identify three different types of morphosyntactic ambiguity: 
intraparadigmatic, morphosyntactically incongruent, and morphosyntactically 
congruent. A recent study by Author (2015) found that about 7.5\% of 
morphosyntactic ambiguity in a corpus of Russian resulted in stress placement 
ambiguity. The following examples make use of stress ambiguity to illustrate 
each kind of ambiguity. \emph{Intraparadigmatic} ambiguity refers to homographic 
wordforms belonging to the same lexeme, as shown in \ref{ex:intrahom}. 

\needspace{4\baselineskip} % keeps example all together (no orphan line) 
\ex. Intraparadigmatic homographs \label{ex:intrahom}
\a. \rus{т\'{е}ла} \emph{t\'{e}la} `body.\textsubscript{SG-GEN}' 
    \label{ex:bodySGGEN}
\b. \rus{тел\'{а}} \emph{tel\'{a}} `body.\textsubscript{PL-NOM}' 
    \label{ex:bodyPLNOM}

The remaining two types of ambiguity occur between lexemes. 
\emph{Morphosyntactically incongruent} ambiguity occurs between homographs that 
belong to separate lexemes, and whose morphosyntactic values are different, as 
shown in \ref{ex:MSincongruent}.

\needspace{4\baselineskip} % keeps example all together (no orphan line) 
\ex. Morphosyntactically incongruent homographs \label{ex:MSincongruent}
\a. \rus{н\'{а}шей} \emph{nášej} `our.\textsubscript{F-SG-GEN/DAT/LOC...}'\\
    \rus{наш\'{е}й} \emph{našéj} `sew on.\textsubscript{IMP-2SG}'
\b. \rus{дор\'{о}га} \emph{doróga} `road.\textsubscript{N-F-SG-NOM}'\\
    \rus{дорог\'{а}} \emph{dorogá} `dear.\textsubscript{ADJ-F-SG-PRED}'

\emph{Morphosyntactically congruent} ambiguity occurs between homographs 
that belong to separate lexemes, and whose morphosyntactic values are identical, 
as shown in \ref{ex:MScongruent}. As indicated in Table~\ref{table:ambiguity}, 
this kind of ambiguity is relatively rare, and resolving this ambiguity requires 
the use of technologies such as word sense disambiguation.

\needspace{6\baselineskip} % keeps example all together (no orphan line) 
\ex. Morphosyntactically congruent homographs \label{ex:MScongruent}
\a. \rus{з\'{a}мок} \emph{z\'{a}mok} `castle.\textsubscript{SG-NOM}'\\
	\rus{зам\'{о}к} \emph{zam\'{o}k} `lock.\textsubscript{SG-NOM}'
\b. \rus{з\'{a}мков} \emph{z\'{a}mkov} `castle.\textsubscript{PL-GEN}'\\
	\rus{замк\'{о}в} \emph{zamk\'{o}v} `lock.\textsubscript{PL-GEN}'
\c. ...\\
	...

Table \ref{table:ambiguity} shows the proportional prevalence of each kind of 
ambiguity. Note that these proportions do not sum to 1, since a given token may 
exhibit more than one kind of ambiguity. The first column shows the proportion 
of all tokens in a corpus that have each kind of ambiguity. The second column 
shows what proportion of ambiguous tokens exhibit each kind of ambiguity.

Table~\ref{table:ambiguity} shows that most morphosyntactic ambiguity in 
unrestricted Russian text is rooted in intraparadigmatic and morphosyntactically 
incongruent ambiguity. Detailed part-of-speech tagging with morphosyntactic 
analysis can help disambiguate these forms. Morphosyntactically congruent stress 
ambiguity cannot be disambiguated by means of detailed part-of-speech tagging, 
and since congruent stress ambiguity represents only a small percentage of 
ambiguous wordforms, we leave it to future work.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Corpus}

In order to evaluate the grammar we hand-annotated 10,150 words of Russian text
from Wikipedia articles, public domain literature and freely-available news sources. The
annotated texts are available online under the {\sc cc-by-sa} licence.\footnote{\url{...}}

Hand-annotation proceeded as follows: The text was first morphologically analysed, 
and then an annotator read through the output of the morphological analyser, commenting
out the readings which were not appropriate in context. This annotated text was then checked
by a second annotator.

We chose our own texts as opposed to using a well-known hand-annotated corpus
such as the Russian National Corpus (RNC) for two main reasons: the first was that the 
RNC is not freely available; the second was that the standards for tokenisation, part-of-speech
and morphological description are different from our morphological analyser.
