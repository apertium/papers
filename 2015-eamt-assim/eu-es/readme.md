Evaluation of Basque-Spanish Apertium machine translation system
------

This folder contains the data related to an assimilation evaluation experiment of Apertium Basque-Spanish machine translation system. The evaluation took place on the modified version of [Appraise][1] evaluation platform located at [Apertium server][2]. The XML task files can be found in the *task source files* folder. *Exported_results.xml* contains the results obtained from Appraise system. *Tables.pdf* contains the analyzed results, and *tables.tex* contains the same document in .tex format. Values in tables 1 and 2 represent an average rate of correct answers for all evaluators and its standard deviation (in percent). Values in tables 3 and 4 are calculated as sum of correct answers of all evaluators divided by a total number of gaps filled by all evaluators.
See [Apertium wiki][3] for more details.
